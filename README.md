The objective is to design a model to properly classify transactions as either legit or fraudulent based on it’s learning through historic data.Then the model will be incorporated into dummy payment gateway. The model will help to prevent transactions which it identifies as suspicious by suspending the transaction for additional verification.Since the dataset might be unbalanced we will be using modern data science techniques to fit the data according to the needs of the machine learning algorithm/model, for example: Oversampling etc.We will be training the model using the curated dataset.We will testing and tuning the model’s error rate to improve its performance.We will be integrating the generating model with our dummy payment gateway website and test the whole package
